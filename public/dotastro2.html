<h1>.Astronomy 2</h1>

<h2>November 30 – Dec 4, 2009</h2>

<h2>Venue: Lorentz Centre, Leiden</h2>

<p><strong>Local Organisers:</strong> Sarah Kendrew, Carolina Ödman.</p>

<p>.Astronomy 2 was held in the excellent Lorentz Centre, part of the University of Leiden. It was the event where we first held Unconference sessions and a Hack Day. Both were very popular during this five-day marathon meeting. The Lorentz Centre’s offices-and-desks setup, and bicycles were a big hit with attendees.</p>
