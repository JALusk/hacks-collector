List of .Astronomy hacks
========================

This repository is intended to contain information about all hacks that have
been carried out as part of the .Astronomy meetings. Each meeting has a folder
which in turn contains one file for each hack. Adding a file to this repository
is easy, and we describe the file format and the steps to take to add a file
below.

The file format
---------------

Each hack should be described by a file that looks like this:

    title: My awesome hack
    creators:
        - Anne Onymous
        - John Doe
    description: this was a hack to do this really cool thing
    source-url: http://github.com/hacker1/hack1
    live-url: http://hack1.herokuapp.com
    doi: http://zenodo.org/1029812
    images: hack1.jpg
    
The file format is called YAML, but you don't need to worry if you don't know
this - we explain all the details below.

The ``title``, ``creators``, and ``description`` fields are always required

The following fields are optional:

* ``source-url``: for code hacks, this is the URL or URLs to where the source
  code for the hack is stored - this can be for example a GitHub or BitBucket
  repository.
  
* ``live-url``: when applicable, this is the URL or URLs for the 'finished' product,
  for example a website or a video.

* ``doi``: if you archive your hack on a service such as
  [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) or [figshare](https://figshare.com) (and we
  highly encourage you to do so - see instructions below), this is the DOI to
  that archived version.
  
* ``images``: if you have screenshots or other related images for your hacks,
  you can include the filenames here, and include the images in your submission.

* ``contact-email``: contact details for one of the hack participants who we
  could contact in future if needed.
  
* ``contact-github``: the GitHub username for one or more of the hack
  participants who we could contact in future if needed.
  
* ``orcid``: the ORCID(s) for one or more of the participants

Note that if you need to give multiple values for a field (such as for
creators, URLs, ORCID IDs), you can use the following syntax:

    fieldname:
        - value1
        - value2
        
If you want to put a paragraph of text, e.g. for the description, you can do:

    fieldname: >
      Hic autem sit officia. Et accusantium molestias dicta laboriosam qui.
      Deleniti est soluta voluptatem aut. Officia sed ipsum iste quos debitis
      modi aut. Est nihil in ea harum animi est doloremque. Aut ut aut aut.
      
That is, you should put a ``>`` on the first line then indent all the rest by a
couple of spaces.
